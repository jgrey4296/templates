Org Capture Template Expansions:

%[FILE]    # Insert the contents of the file given by FILE.
%(EXP)     # Evaluate Elisp expression EXP and replace it with the result. The EXP form must return a string. Only placeholders pre-existing within the template, or introduced with %[file] are expanded this way. Since this happens after expanding non-interactive “%-escapes”, those can be used to fill the expression.
%<FORMAT>  # The result of format-time-string on the FORMAT specification.
%t         # Timestamp, date only.
%T         # Timestamp, with date and time.
%u         # Like %t %T   above, but inactive timestamps.
%U         # Like %t %T   above, but inactive timestamps.
%i         # Initial content, the region when capture is called while the region is active. If there is text before %i on the same line, such as indentation, and %i  is not inside a %(exp) form, that prefix is added before every line in the inserted text.
%a         # Annotation, normally the link created with org-store-link.
%A         # Like %a but prompt for the description part.
%l         # Like %a but only insert the literal link.
%L         # Like %l but without brackets (the link content itself).
%c         # Current kill ring head.
%x         # Content of the X clipboard.
%k         # Title of the currently clocked task.
%K         # Link to the currently clocked task.
%n         # User name (taken from user-full-name).
%f         # File visited by current buffer when org-capture was called.
%F         # Full path of the file or directory visited by current buffer.
%:keyword  # Specific information for certain link types, see below.
%^g        # Prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.
%^G        # Prompt for tags, with completion all tags in all agenda files.
%^t        # Like %t but prompt for date. Similarly %^T %^u %^U You may define a prompt like %^{Birthday}t # .
%^C        # Interactive selection of which kill or clip to use.
%^L        # Like %^C # , but insert as link.
%^{PROP}p  # Prompt the user for a value for property PROP. You may specify a default value with %^{PROP|default}.
%^{PROMPT} # Prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it. You may specify a default value and a completion table with %^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3...}. The arrow keys access a prompt-specific history.
%\N        # Insert the text entered at the Nth %^{PROMPT} where N is a number, starting from 1.
%?         # After completing the template, position point here.
