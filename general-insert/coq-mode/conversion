Rocq Conversion Rules:
alpha-conversion # syntactic equivalence ignoring variable name differences.
beta-reduction   # rewriting function applications with their arguments.
delta-reduction  # replaces variables/constants with their values.
iota-reduction   # destructors applied to object / match+fix+cofix reduction.
zeta-reduction   # removes let-in definitions with the values.
eta-expansion    # expands terms into lambda functions.
match-reduction  # eliminates 'match'
fix-reduction    # replaces 'fix' with beta reduction.
cofix-reduction  # replaces 'cofix' with beta reduction.
