Python Else Statement:
if-else     # `else` when `if` doesnt.
while-else  # `else` when `while` fails.
for-else    # `else` when iterator is exhausted.
try-else    # `else` when no exception is raise.
try-finally # `finally` always runs.

break       # short circuits the logic, stopping else being run.
